I have made virtual piano using html, css, js.


instruction: click on the keys using cursor to see visual and sound effects.


I have created various features in this like:

1. on clicking the keys of piano it will show the visual effect which is created using shadow and gradient effect.
2. every click on the key will make a sound of piano keys.
3. I have also created the dark mode toogle key whick keeps the eye comfortable which makes the background color of body to black and heading color white and make it reverse when again clicked.
